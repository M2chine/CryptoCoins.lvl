# Translate
It would be nice, if you can help me to translate this program. Here is how to do it:

1. Open [translations.js][1] and add a translation for each item. Add brackets just like in the other translated sentences.
2. Open **main.js** and add the abbreviation of the added language (e.g. "es") to the end of the "languages" array. This array can currently be found in [line 77][2].
3. Open **index.html** and add an option with the language that you added, eg. `<option value="es">es</option>`. This code can currently be found in [line 42][3].
4. Save all three files and start a Pull Request.
5. Get a big kiss from the maintainer.
